- project: The Effectiveness of Temporal Dependency in Deepfake Video Detection
  role: Lead Researcher
  duration: 2020
  url: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06684"
  description: We find that temporal dependency produces a statistically significant (p < 0.05) increase in performance in classifying real images for the model using automatic feature selection, demonstrating that spatio-temporal information can increase the performance of deepfake video detection models.
